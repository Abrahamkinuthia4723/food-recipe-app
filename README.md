### This project is a web application called "Find Meal For Your Ingredients." The main purpose of this application is to help users find meals based on the ingredients they have on hand. The application has a clean and user-friendly interface, with a search bar that allows users to input an ingredient and search for meals that contain it.

### The application uses the Themealdb API to fetch meal data based on the user's search input. When the user enters an ingredient and clicks the search button, the application sends a request to the API with the ingredient as a parameter. The API then returns a list of meals that contain the specified ingredient, which the application displays on the page.

### Each meal in the search results is displayed as a card with an image, name, and a button to view the recipe. When the user clicks the "Get Recipe" button, the application fetches the recipe for that meal from the API and displays it in a modal. The recipe modal includes the meal name, category, instructions, an image, and a link to a video tutorial.

### The application also includes a "not found" message that is displayed when the API does not return any meals for the user's search input. This message is displayed in a red box to make it stand out from the rest of the content on the page.

### The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML code defines the structure of the application, including the search bar, meal cards, and recipe modal. The CSS code styles the application, giving it a clean and modern look. The JavaScript code handles the functionality of the application, including fetching meal data from the API, displaying the meal cards and recipe modal, and handling user input.

### Overall, this project is a useful tool for anyone who wants to find meals based on the ingredients they have on hand. It has a simple and intuitive interface, and it uses a popular API to fetch meal data. The application is well-designed and easy to use, making it a great resource for anyone who loves to cook!
